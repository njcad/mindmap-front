MindMap is an interactive web platform for teachers to ask questions, students to share responses, and an LLM pipeline to generate optimal conversation groups based on student responses. This is a demo version of MindMap that we have made publicly available to share its most essential features. It includes teacher views, student views, and calls to our database to log essential session data like questions asked, student responses, and discussion group assignments. We believe such a tool could be immensely useful to engage all kinds of students in collaborating together and providing teachers a high level overview of their classroom's interests.
